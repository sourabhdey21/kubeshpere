# KubeSphere 

KubeSphere is a distributed operating system for cloud-native application management, using Kubernetes as its kernel. It provides a plug-and-play architecture, allowing third-party applications to be seamlessly integrated into its ecosystem.

KubeSphere also represents a multi-tenant enterprise-grade Kubernetes container platform with full-stack automated IT operation and streamlined DevOps workflows. It provides developer-friendly wizard web UI, helping enterprises to build out a robust and feature-rich platform. It boasts the most common functionalities needed for enterprise Kubernetes strategies, such as Kubernetes resource management, DevOps (CI/CD), application lifecycle management, monitoring, logging, service mesh, multi-tenancy, alerting and notification, auditing, storage and networking, autoscaling, access control, GPU support, multi-cluster deployment and management, network policy, registry management, and security management.

The KubeSphere team developed KubeKey, an open-source brand-new installer, to help enterprises quickly set up a Kubernetes cluster on public clouds or data centers. Users have the option to install Kubernetes only or install both KubeSphere and Kubernetes. KubeKey provides users with different installation options such as all-in-one installation and multi-node installation. It is also an efficient tool to install cloud-native add-ons, and upgrade and scale your Kubernetes cluster.
